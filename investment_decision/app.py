        <p>Welcome to my app! First, a brief introduction is in order.</p>

        <p>My name is Rommel Artola, and I'm a Data Scientist. I'm passionate about finding answers to 
            complicated questions and building things to make those decisions easier. 
            Feel free to connect with me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/rommelartola/' target='_blank'>Linkedin</a>!</p>
        
        <p>This app was inspired by a decision I'm currently weighing myself. With interest rates and home prices at all-time highs, 
        homeownership feels less like an "expected" milestone and more like a calculated investment decision (whatever that means)..</p>

        <p>This app lets you project and visualize the difference between owning a home and renting while investing in the stock market (via a low-cost index fund, for example)
            to help you decide which path might leave you with more value at the end.</p>

        <p>There are some limitations ‚Äî most compounding values in this calculator happen consistently, while in real life they may not. Look at the historic trends of your specific values.
            For example, your rent might not increase one year, but this calculator assumes it always does. The same applies to a home's value and other investment.</p>

        <p>It's up to you to tweak the inputs and run different simulations based on your specific area and situation.</p>

        <p>To get the most out of this app, be sure to explore the ‚ÄúOptional Home Settings‚Äù section ‚Äî this is where you can really tailor the experience to fit your situation.</p>

        <p>Each input has an info button (denoted by the ‚Äú?‚Äù on the right). Hover over it if you ever have questions ‚Äî there are detailed assumptions behind each input.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out or connect using the Linkedin link above.</p>
        
        <p style='margin-top: 2em;'>Enjoy!</p>
